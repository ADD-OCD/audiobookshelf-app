 * Fixed presentation recipes selected by the validated `presentation.finish` token.

 * - 'equipment' is a repository-owned recipe (bevels, recessed wells, ...). Its selectors, property
 *   names and structure live here, in code. Theme data only chooses the recipe and supplies validated
 *   colors: rules reference token variables, and the derived edge colors below are computed from
 *   validated channels with fixed blend factors that theme data cannot influence.
 *
 * Selectors are built only from validated built-in theme ids (engine.themeSelector).
 * CommonJS on purpose: used by tailwind.config.js at build time.
